# This is a GitLab CI configuration to build the project as a docker image
# The file is generic enough to be dropped in a project containing a working Dockerfile

Build:
  stage: build
  script:
    # fetches the latest image (not failing if image is not found)
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest || true
    # builds the project, passing proxy variables, and vcs vars for LABEL

# Here, the goal is to tag the "master" branch as "latest"
Push latest:
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  stage: push
  only:
    # Only "master" should be tagged "latest"
    - master
  script:
    # Because we have no guarantee that this job will be picked up by the same runner 
    # that built the image in the previous step, we pull it again locally
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    # Then we tag it "latest"
    - docker tag $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
    # And we push it.
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest

# Finally, the goal here is to Docker tag any Git tag
# GitLab will start a new pipeline everytime a Git tag is created, which is pretty awesome
Push tag:
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  stage: push
  only:
    # We want this job to be run on tags only.
    - tags
  script:
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
    - docker tag $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
